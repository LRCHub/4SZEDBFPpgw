[00:32.27] I'll make it right again
[00:34.70] "But it's no use"
[00:36.45] You said
[00:37.24] As my hunger grows and grows
[00:42.05] I have to write the meaning of my life
[00:47.57] Or else everything's in vain
[01:01.57] 
[00:52.87] When the glory tries to tempt you
[00:57.64] It may seem like what you need
[01:02.57] But if glory makes you happy, why are you so broken up?
[01:30.07] 
[01:11.57] So tell me, how it felt when you walked on water?
[01:18.59] Did you get your wish?
[01:22.33] Floating to the surface
[01:25.03] Quicker than you sank
[01:28.38] Idol, idol
[01:33.38] 
[01:31.86] So tell me, how it felt when you walked on water?
[01:38.72] Did you get your wish?
[01:42.57] Floating to the surface
[01:45.12] Quicker than you sank
[01:48.36] Idol, idol
[01:53.36] 
[02:02.90] Don't say you lose just yet
[02:05.67] Get up and move ahead
[02:08.33] And not only for yourself
[02:13.16] 'Cause that's your role
[02:14.76] The work that stirred your soul
[02:18.31] You can make for someone else
[02:32.81] 
[02:23.09] One day you choke
[02:25.24] The urges overflow
[02:28.73] And obsession wears you down
[02:33.47] But don't you waste the suffering you've faced
[02:38.82] It will serve you in due time
[02:53.32] 
[02:42.43] So tell me, how it felt when you walked on water?
[02:49.94] Did you get your wish?
[02:53.53] Floating to the surface
[02:56.29] Quicker than you sank
[02:59.49] Idol, idol
[03:04.49] 
[03:03.09] So tell me, how it felt when you walked on water?
[03:10.16] Did you get your wish?
[03:13.76] Floating to the surface
[03:16.43] Quicker than you sank
[03:19.44] Idol, idol
[03:22.74] So tell me
